I have implemented this project to showcase some of my python and json skills:
The Project: Clipboard Manager

This simple Python script serves as a command-line clipboard manager.
It allows you to save, load, and list items stored with associated keys in a JSON file.
The stored data can be retrieved and copied to the clipboard based on user commands.

It can come in handy when you do not want to overwrite what you quickly copied and you want to use it later.
Just choose a key that is related to the value you want to copy and then later access it with that key.
